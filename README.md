gitignore
=========

Instead of ignoring files or folders individually I prefer to ignore everything except the files that are modified. I haven't really looked into how efficient this is for git but it works great for me particularly in instances where I need to modify core code or when code I can modify exists within a folder I would otherwise ignore. This makes the gitignore files much easier to manage in my opinion.
